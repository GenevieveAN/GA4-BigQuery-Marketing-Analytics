## Projects

### ðŸ“Š [Acquisition-based cohort analysis (Channel Performance Analysis)](./channel-performance-analysis/)
Analysis of marketing channel effectiveness using traffic, engagement, and revenue metrics.
- **Key Finding**: Referral traffic delivered the highest revenue per session ($12.58 vs $6.37 for Direct traffic)
- **Business Impact**: Informed budget reallocation recommendations



### ðŸ“Š [E-commerce Funnel analysis](funnel-analysis)
This analysis demonstrates how funnel analysis can reveal hidden conversion barriers and prioritize optimization efforts for maximum business impact. 
- **Key Finding**: Rather than optimizing multiple touchpoints across different channels, addressing one universal bottleneck can deliver maximum ROI with minimal development effort.
- **Business Impact**: This funnel analysis revealed that **all marketing channels shared the same critical bottleneck: cart-to-checkout transition**, with 46-92% of users abandoning at this stage. By fixing this single friction point, the business could:

  - Increase overall conversions by 30-300% across channels
  - Generate 82+ additional purchases from existing traffic
  - Eliminate wasted ad spend on underperforming channels (Paid Search at 2% conversion)
  - Reallocate budget to high-performing channels (Referral: 11.3% conversion, $12.58/session)
